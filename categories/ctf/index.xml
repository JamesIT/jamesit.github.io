      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start a series of blog posts with write ups from Vuln Hub to keep my skills up to date, and learn more offensive techniques.
The first step was to use nmap which revealed the presence of various open ports and in particular port 80 (HTTP).
nmap -sS -T5 192.168.74.134 Nmap scan report for 192.168.74.134 Host is up (0.00018s latency). Not shown: 994 closed ports PORT STATE SERVICE 22/tcp open ssh 80/tcp open http 111/tcp open rpcbind 443/tcp open https 631/tcp open ipp 3306/tcp open mysql</description>

      <description>The other week me and a team from Abertay University went to Edinburgh for a CTF hosted by SIGINT. The CTF was a jeopardy style CTF with various categories of challenges such as Binary Exploitation, Reverse Engineering, Web Challenges and more. Unfortunately as there was a team limit of four, I was unable to join the team from my university and was placed with another team.
I decided I&amp;rsquo;d post a blog post on some of the challenges I undertook, and how I solved them.</description>
