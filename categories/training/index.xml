      <description>Over the Christmas break from university, I decided that I&amp;rsquo;d take the PWK (OSCP) course which gave me something to do over the Christmas break and ensured I had plenty of time to complete the course. Having previously done other cyber security courses such as Comp Tia Security+ and eLearnSecurity&amp;rsquo;s PTPV4 course, I liked the fact that the PWK course was heavily practical in nature and had an extensive virtual lab to test penetration testing techniques on a variety of systems.</description>

      <description>So about three weeks ago I won an &amp;ldquo;Elite&amp;rdquo; edition of the new mobile penetration testing course from eLearnSecurity by watching their webinar and being randomly selected. I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about this course and have been getting started now that it&amp;rsquo;s been released. I really did not expect to win either!
This really helps being on a student budget, and will be relevant to the mobile development module at Abertay University next semester, I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting a review once I finish and pass the course.</description>
