      <description>Just thought I&amp;rsquo;d make a post regarding what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to this year. I have been in the United States Of America since July 2015 for a study abroad program which I was very lucky to be accepted onto, and have been making the most of this opportunity since I got here. I completed two Semesters at the Pennsylvania College Of Technology and have also been working as an EMT for the college responding to 911 emergencies and volunteering with the fire department.</description>

      <description>I’m now in the United States Of America, and have completed EMT-Basic at Pelham Training. It’s been an amazing experience, especially participating in clinical rotations at Monroe Emergency Room and Owens County EMS. During my shift we were dispatched to difficulty breathing and unfortunately for me that was the only call we got for the entire shift, one thing I did notice was they send ambulances on lights and sirens for mostly all calls, and then on way back to hospital decide if lights and sirens will be needed, where as in the UK the calls get categorised.</description>
