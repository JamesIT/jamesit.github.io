OpenPGP Key Transition Statement for James Hemmings / james@hemmings.pw
I have created a new OpenPGP key and will be transitioning away from my old key. The old key has not been compromised and will continue to be valid for a short period of time, but I prefer all future correspondence to be encrypted to the new key, and will be making signatures with the new key going forward.</description>

      <description>Just been thinking about my plans for this year, and been thinking about taking OSCP over the summer period to help increase my skills in the penetration testing field. It seems to be a really good challenging course, which tests your abilities and with it being valuable to employers, something I should do and is the logical next step after the eLearnSecurity eCPPT course I did last year.

Â Anyone else took this course before?</description>

      <description>I decided to schedule the exam for today as I felt I was ready, and after taking the exam I scored 825/900! Which is a pretty decent score, although I am going to re-go over the two topics I didn&amp;rsquo;t do so good in.
Overall after taking the exam, I felt it was pretty easy after my three weeks of study. I used a combination of Darril Gibson&amp;rsquo;s book, Professer Messer Videos along with flashcards.</description>
