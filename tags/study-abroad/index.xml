      <description>Just thought I&amp;rsquo;d make a post regarding what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to this year. I have been in the United States Of America since July 2015 for a study abroad program which I was very lucky to be accepted onto, and have been making the most of this opportunity since I got here. I completed two Semesters at the Pennsylvania College Of Technology and have also been working as an EMT for the college responding to 911 emergencies and volunteering with the fire department.</description>
