      <description>Back inÂ February I found an Android application which is used by the emergency services, that had exposed Azure API keys within the application leading to potential compromise of sensitive incident reports, attachments, and infrastructure server &amp;ldquo;.vhd&amp;rdquo; files with the access level to spin up new instances or delete them. I immediately reported this to the application developer and it&amp;rsquo;s respective organisation under responsible disclosure, which resulted in an instant and prompt response, which I give huge kudos for.</description>

      <description>So about three weeks ago I won an &amp;ldquo;Elite&amp;rdquo; edition of the new mobile penetration testing course from eLearnSecurity by watching their webinar and being randomly selected. I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about this course and have been getting started now that it&amp;rsquo;s been released. I really did not expect to win either!
This really helps being on a student budget, and will be relevant to the mobile development module at Abertay University next semester, I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting a review once I finish and pass the course.</description>
