      <description>I’m now in the United States Of America, and have completed EMT-Basic at Pelham Training. It’s been an amazing experience, especially participating in clinical rotations at Monroe Emergency Room and Owens County EMS. During my shift we were dispatched to difficulty breathing and unfortunately for me that was the only call we got for the entire shift, one thing I did notice was they send ambulances on lights and sirens for mostly all calls, and then on way back to hospital decide if lights and sirens will be needed, where as in the UK the calls get categorised.</description>
