      <description>After performing security testing on the 4GEE Mobile WiFi router it was discovered to be vulnerable to several security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities in combination make it possible for an attacker to remotely exploit the device, which can be achieved through having a user view a crafted texted message that was sent to him.
Other attacks are also possible by misleading and/or tricking users into executing code or clicking crafted URLs to trigger multiple functions such as device reset, device reboot, device restore (malicious config), sending SMS messages or stealing device configuration information, SMS messages and any other information on the device that a user may have access to and without authentication.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a user of the mobile/web application named &amp;ldquo;GoodSAM App&amp;rdquo; which is an application where the Ambulance service in London or the East Midlands can dispatch &amp;ldquo;Responders&amp;rdquo; who are trained in Basic Life Support (BLS) and can be dispatched to cardiac arrests or other priority calls and users at emergencies can also request a &amp;ldquo;Responder&amp;rdquo;. Now this application is absolutely brilliant in the nature of what it does and I fully support them.</description>
