      <description>Over the Christmas break from university, I decided that I&amp;rsquo;d take the PWK (OSCP) course which gave me something to do over the Christmas break and ensured I had plenty of time to complete the course. Having previously done other cyber security courses such as Comp Tia Security+ and eLearnSecurity&amp;rsquo;s PTPV4 course, I liked the fact that the PWK course was heavily practical in nature and had an extensive virtual lab to test penetration testing techniques on a variety of systems.</description>

      <description>Just been thinking about my plans for this year, and been thinking about taking OSCP over the summer period to help increase my skills in the penetration testing field. It seems to be a really good challenging course, which tests your abilities and with it being valuable to employers, something I should do and is the logical next step after the eLearnSecurity eCPPT course I did last year.

Â Anyone else took this course before?</description>
