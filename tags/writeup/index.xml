      <description>The other week me and a team from Abertay University went to Edinburgh for a CTF hosted by SIGINT. The CTF was a jeopardy style CTF with various categories of challenges such as Binary Exploitation, Reverse Engineering, Web Challenges and more. Unfortunately as there was a team limit of four, I was unable to join the team from my university and was placed with another team.
I decided I&amp;rsquo;d post a blog post on some of the challenges I undertook, and how I solved them.</description>
